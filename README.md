Dear Team,
The root cause of the issue is still under investigation. At this stage, findings indicate that the problem is at the Transact level, and therefore AWS is not involved at this point.

No abnormal spikes have been observed since the incident, and the service remains under close monitoring.



Hi Mohamed,

Yes, the issue was raised with AFS at 12 PM, and we received a response around 4 PM stating that this is how the data is being received from Mastercard, which in turn is coming from the merchant.

The response was being validated with IT to ensure that there’s no further sms enrichment  that can be done by our end before we respond back to afs.

We have asked AFS to follow up with Mastercard/aquirer to check whether the merchant name can be corrected, and also requested a comparison between transactions showing “Talabat” vs those showing “delivery with del” to help mc identify the discrepancy with the mc/aquirer.
